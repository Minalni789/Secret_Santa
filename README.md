# Secret_Santa
This program is a Secret Santa generator. It prompts the user to input a list of participant names,
ensures that no person is matched with themselves by shuffling the gift assignments until all participants have
been matched with a different person. It then prints the final match results,
showing each person and their assigned gift recipient.
